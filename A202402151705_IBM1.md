`A202402151705` thoughts on my last paper during my PhD period

I will write down my thoughts, emotion experience about this paper and its meanings for me. it is an end and also a new start for me.

1. begining, it was finished finally, all presures go away. I have been torched by two side for more than 2 years, for somethings that will not benefit me from external word, just for internal pease, is that worth?

2. all thoughts and significance about the project. my strugglings between hypothesis and really world facts.

3. thanks for the help of Bob and Hosung.

4. I can hardly tell the real and idea word, I think everything will be fine for me after I finished, but it turn out now, everything has no changes except no longer need to work on it. people still leave me and life not become better,
   but something different only I know about it. it is a pure dream dance in a very limited space, I try hard to protect its purity and intact from pressure of others and external world. it is something I want to do in my life that not for others, just for myself, its finally finishment indicate a huge success of mine. I finally win the game for myself. it is not easy for me. I seems can easily prioritez others to myself. this is the onlything, I come up with all for myself. to me it is not a research paper, it is a represeative work about a true me, and my true interests of functional and evolutionary genetics.

it is a full stop and also a new start.

epigenetics, genetics, integrative association about genomic features to interpret function and phynotypes for living species.


1. epigentic balance in arabidopsis

2. genetic research in population genetics.

3. epigenectis and function study in pediatric cancer and cell line models.
